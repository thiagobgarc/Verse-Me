# Verse-Me

https://verse-me1234896.netlify.app

For my first project I decided to take things slow and grasp 
JS by retrieving data through an API, either from a search bar or
randomized button. I used DOM manipulation to retrieve the data on 
two API's. One is specifically to search and the other to randomize.

You will see in the JS file how I organized the two and psuedo-code
the entire page to give you a better understanding on how I wrote 
my code. 


### Problems
<ul>
<li>
Attempting to find a way to randomze the Verse of the Day button. It took 
some time and after I decided to not continue with the current API for that 
specific section of my JS code, I decided to aquire a second API. This 
second API is used mainly for randomizing verses, so it worked like a charm.
</li>

<li>
Attempting to create an animation for my web application. It drove me nuts, 
however, after much research I eventually created an infinite animation that would create a pulsating effect that would give off a shadlow effect. It gives life 
to the web application.
</li>
</ul>

### Strengths

<ul>
<li>
My understanding of DOM manipulation and DOT notation has helped me write the
few lines of code so that it remain DRY.
</li>

<li>
Throughout the problems I remained calm and approached everything thinking how can I fix an issue the easiest way. After, I would fix the issue, the next thing i would do is think about what my instructor would always say, "How can I better my code?"
So, I would constantly tweak it according to peoples usage and always be attentive to the webapplication to keep that user-friendly interface. 
</li>
</ul>
