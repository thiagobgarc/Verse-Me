For my first project I decided to take things slow and truly grasp 
JS by retrieving data through an API, either from a search bar or
randomized button. I used DOM manipulation to retrieve the data on 
two API's. One is specifically to search and the other to randomize.

You will see in the JS file how I organized the two and psuedo-code
the entire page to give you a better understanding on how I wrote 
my code.
